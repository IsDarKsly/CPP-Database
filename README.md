# CPP-Database
Is it a real CPP Database? Probably not, but it helped me brush up on some C++. Hated every moment

# How do I run this?
Export code into a folder, open a terminal in said folder, and run the following command

`g++ main.cpp -o app.exe`

Or, if you wanna see some disgusting debugging information

`g++ main.cpp -DDEBUGMODE -o app.exe`

If you enjoy using Windows, feel free to use the simple .ps1 files as make files, these will run those scripts for you.

# What else should I add?
I should definitely finish up adding categories. After that, I should add simple Data Analysis (Probably never)

# How do I know this whole thing isn't AI-generated
pfft, AI writes way better C++ code than I do, and is aware of libraries so obscure you'd have to deep dive into forums to find. Besides, I think I mispelled Categories on literally every instance, which takes skill.
